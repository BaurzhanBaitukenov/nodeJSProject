# nodeJSProject
This project is made for final exam of Advanced Databases NoSQL course. 
This is a sample of website, where we sell the games keys to customers by prices, that are better than in original platforms.
It is written by using Node.js and in views section it is almost similar to HTML, but you can add inline JavaScript to this project.
In order to start working with this project, you'll need to pull it from origin and launch npm install to fetch all the dependencies. The website is very simple it contains only 2 modules, users and products. Most part of the website is made for an admin, which can check the operation of users, crud and all products are created by an admins of website.
Database system that is used in this project is MongoDB, because it's what we learn during the course, also of its simple json models of keeping information.
Unfortunately, without permission of Baurzhan, which has the access to database cluster, you'll not be able to use the website fully, but you can check the controllers to see which methods are used and their code or just contact Baurzhan and ask him to open the cluster for everyone.
